Yeah, it has a bunch of great scenes where the two don't quite connect 
Yes it is good
i mean creature, sorry
Hello
Me too.  The more unexpected, the better!
I think they have a strong defense to beat the Chitauri invaders. 
Plus how many times are you going to leave your kid behind. I see they added another scene.  How the robbers got caught and Kevin reuniting with his mom and family
But reading the introduction makes me want to watch it again!
Yeah, even though I love comedies, this wasn't 1 of my faves
Nice! 
I enjoyed it, one of my favored comic book adaptations
Yes, there are two sequels to the original and those are just as great.
Oh, and Maleficent is the dark witch?
did jennifer aniston know that he has god powers? I do not remember that part
that is a good scene they are refering to, when Aurelio tells him something like john wick is the boogeyman or something lol
ok. sounds interesting. did she witness anything she did not suppose to at her workplace?
I loved the story & how true they made it in how  teen girls act but I honestly don't know why I didn't rate it highly as all the right ingredients were there. I cannot believe it was 2004 it was released though, 14 years ago!
Yes you definitely should
Hi there
I think all 3 were fair!
Do you like old movies
Oh, I love Steve Carroll!
I do.  I adore sci-fi. You?
hi
Even CinemaScore, that usually is more reliable, only gave it a B
That is very high
One of the things I wasn't a fan of was the fact that  Mia  didn't really have any development. 
that good
uh-oh
Wait I.T was actually 2005! I’m sorry
turing proposaes marrige and is accepted but admits he is a homosexual?
That sounds funny, I like Morgan Freeman
Me too!  I also loved how Ariadne had to construct each dream level
The Metacritic score is 87/100
Umm, based on cast mainly, I have different taste from most people and ratings
dram biopic movie
now another key scene was added.
Do you know when it came ou?
the ratings are very low for both rotten tomatoes and metacritic
we're done though anyway. rember next time
It was rated very highly by critics all over the world
I've never seen it. What's it about?
Not necessarily, but I think that can help.  An actor doesn't become high-profile unless they are really good at what they do.  What do you think?
I see what you mean.
9 out of 10 or 100
Hey still here?
I liked it a lot, and I think it's among my favorites
Hello how are you?
It was sad that he died at the end.
I figured it was a drama film
thats more that possilbe
I think you watched this movie also
indeed it is. shall we talk movies?
yes 
Ok sorry mine looked as though it did but its the same story. 
Yes, I just watched La La Land
Andd you wouldnt want to get in the bad side of Ms Perkins, played by Adrianne Palicky
sure. That's the point of the self help book. For girls high school can be pretty tough and the movie makes it light of that andat the same time turns it into silly self examination of how kids behave. it's not without a basis that rolling stones called a comic gold. 
Interesting
I really hope Wonder Woman is the start of some good superhero movies from DC>
They loved it.  They spent the next few days speaking in "minion speak".  
yea ot was
I will be finding out soon lol. I am going to guess that American Pie being no1.. I love the irony of Cady breaking the plastic crown at the end 
It's about a mute cleaner and she works at a secret government lab
who was mccorom again?
I don’t know if you’ve heard of this little animate feature call... Toy Story lol
I wanted to see the wonder woman movie because its the only movie with a female superhero as the main character.
not familiar with him but a good movie
the movie just jumped forward passed that. Seb didn't have much growth either. He stayed a jazz snob
Good clean fun for the entire family
it has good ratings  too and the cast are so talented 
That is a good part of the movie.  I can't imagine how the mom felt.  
I think she would be forever remember as wonder woman. As Christopher Reeves  will be Superman.
The woman leaving her home to be with the man is the same old thing that always happens in movies 
no, I didn't see it. 
I will definitely see you soon
I think those people did not like the idea of Morgan Freeman as a god
Yah. Thank you so much this was a great conversatilm
Oh no I agree with you wholeheartedly the trilogy ended to well for there to be a continuation. 
was it human like as far as communication goes?
I agree
The Shape of Water was pretty good, I'd rate it as one of Guillermo del Toro's best movies.
haha. 
How do we know when this task is complete?
Hello
It's definitely an original idea.
no
I like things I can share with my parents
great
Don Rickles and Tom Hanks are great
John wick 2 was actually terrible, nothing as good as the first one 
I’ll have to check this one out for sure. Ah that makes sense, the beginning set up the plot for conning
So, would you go see this movie?
I've heard of it. Whats it about?
I am not sure on that but spielburg is blessed with talent many moviemakers dont posses.  He actually know how to tell a story!
Yes it was 
it was hilarious how macaulay culkin got the crooks so many time 
I see that.  I didn't remember that was the moms name even.  I better rewatch it and refresh my memory. 
Same here
the enigma machine is an important historical item 
It sounds like it would be my kind of thing
Yes you definitely should
like one where the girl, Mia hears the boy,  Sebastian playing the piano  in a bar but he brushes her off 
Additionally, Steve Carroll and Jennifer Aniston are in I.T too
That makes sense.  I just didn't remember that being his name.  I have a neighbor named Marley too.  But she is young and a girl. lol
I agree with them that Ruffalo was great in the movie. 
Yes, he got involved with Christopher Morcom who sparked his interest in crypto
I think maybe the top part, the key scene changed?
Exactly, but when he works there he starts to get the itch to get back into conning, and Carl (who works at the FBI) is constantly worried Carl is gonna disappear again
But we weren't shown how she found the *thing* that helped her grow and become a better actress
What do you think about the 4th  scene?
You? :)
And good to know you had a dachshund too! Interesting. :)
Additionally, Steve Carroll and Jennifer Aniston are in I.T too
hello! 
Sadly no. they drift away as their careers go in different directions. He misses an important play and she moves back home
My favorite character is probably Angelina Jolie's because she is a great actress!
I'm usually not a huge fan but it seemed very genuine 
I can take or leave Jen Aniston
Hello
Great!  You will really enjoy it I'm sure.
I think she is still a good person, just jaded.
Would love to hear about it
turing proposaes marrige and is accepted but admits he is a homosexual?
Are there any other famous actors beside Emma and Ryan?
Yes, Marvel is far better, but all Disney is good!
Morcom was the man who sparked Turing's interest in cryptography
no problem
I think he overdid it a bit. A little to over-the-top. I know Ares is a god and all but... I rolled my eyes everytime he showed up on screen.
cool story factor about him tryingto be fired
it is kinda open ended ending
Well Frank settles down at the FBI (its assumed), and as the credits roll it is revealed the Frank has been married and happy for 26 years, has 3 sons and lives in the Midwest and still maintains a friendship with Carl.
no, never saw it. any good?
Very much so!  But, as a bonus, there are some clever inside jokes that play to parents and grandparents.  It's definitely appropriate for a family movie night.   The overall theme is the importance of family and teaamwork.
I remember seeing this movie as a child and thought it was very funny
It was rated very highly by critics all over the world
Well, Aurora refers to Maleficent as her fairy godmother. 
I might have to watch it to see what you mean. I think failing and trying again shows real depth.
Does it have a happy ending?
Also just visually beautiful  
Hi! Do you like it? I loved How Keanu Reeves acts
Can you tell me the name of any good movie you have seen recently?
i think he did a great job tho 
Perfect!
Career wise or personal like?
I wasn't sure about those two to start out with, they just didn't seem like they'd be good together  
Not necessarily, but I think that can help.  An actor doesn't become high-profile unless they are really good at what they do.  What do you think?
Sure!
 user 2 left the chat now what do I do????
Oh wow Disney, you did a good one! 
What do you think about the defense of the team
Sometimes I think my kids will choose the latter. I need to indoctrinate the better.
i thought it was super romantic
I agree them great in the Avengers   movie. 
My wife had a huge crush on Christopher Reeve, from the Superman movies back in the 80's. Has basically said she would divorce me if I saw these new movies. :
A bit. He has a duet with Emma. He also sings a song or two by himself 
Well, she meets and falls in love with a boy named Stefan.
I love it too. I also enjoy movies that mess with your mind, or give you something you weren't expecting.
I think using love to fight war is the same old thing.
it was too dramatic for a comedy movie
Same with the director, Mark Waters. I cannot think of any other movies he directed but surely he must have made more successful films
I think the description up top got longer
I prefer sci fy but got this vid instead\\
But we weren't shown how she found the *thing* that helped her grow and become a better actress
bye
Morcom was the man who sparked Turing's interest in cryptography
Ah, I see. Who plays him?
She is very good
He did make many good movies.  What are some of your favorites?  Was this the first time you saw Jaws?
Yes, it's quite interesting because he relies on forging checks so there is some tense moments where you're kind of rooting for him even though he's a con man. The premise is in the title "Catch Me If You Can". 
i see thats lol n its sad
Yes, that was instrumental to solving the mysteries of the enigma machine
Hi
I like them. What's this one about?
Hello. How are you? I am not entirely sure about what question to ask, so I'll just ask: do you think the critics were fair in their critique of the movie?
How are you
so  good 
Makes hoe schooling very appealing. I love how the 'mean girls' are known as the plastics, all fake
Do you remember your favorite scene?
movie was cvool ioverall.
I'm usually not a huge fan but it seemed very genuine 
I think I will!
sorry
He was very good
You don't think so?
No, Busty is Andys dog. By the way I'm just  kidding, yeah he is like the dad kind of role in the family of toys since well, he IS Mr. Potato Head. Hahaha.
enjoy it )
the atmosphere of the amazons and their training was the art of my favorites
Is it an animation?
hello
Watching it as an adult now you see it from a different perspective
He doesn't because he loves Mia so much he wants to make her proud
Well, I don't know how you feel about romantic comedies 
Which was your favorite part
I.T is a Science fiction comedy hybrid
It's a really different movie, it's been one of my favorites I've seen in a long time. 
2005
It sounds like it would be my kind of thing
Yea film critics are too stiff. You should watch this movie
What did you think of General Erich/Aries?
I bet! I would too
Good. Have you heard of actor jim carrey
I have, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  How about you?
oh yeah? What year did it come out?
I can agree
It sounds like something I would watch. Than you for the recommendation!
I think I was pretty young when I saw it the first time.  I remember blood, but not all the gruesome scenes.  I doubt my children have seen it.
Overall, I like the movie.  It has some high-profile actors.  What about you?
I will admit, Wonder Woman is the first DC Movie I"ve seen since Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight movies. I do NOT like the new Superman movies. :)
So there is a bit of diversity in the film, that sounds cool. 
There were some complaints that it's too pat - say, everything went so smoothly despite all the pain the boy had endured b/c of his drug-addict mother, feeling unloved, that sort of (awful) thing. Aside from what I mentioned above (the mom's racist friends - whom she rebukes), I don't know about any other backlash. What did you hear?
ummm no spoiler :)
Hi!
sorry
They weren't the best signers I've ever heard but it wasn't like Le Mes bad
It makes me want to watch it again.  How many did they make?  Three?
I like them a lot, The Imitation Game was a good example of this
Is it easily rented online?
  iH
I think from the title I would say the fact that there's animals and it's a kid friendly movie
Robert Downy Jr played Tony Spark
Yes, I just watched La La Land
Yes!  
I know, it was the perfect trilogy.
Ok. Thank you. Bye!
you can either think about it as sad or happy
names his machine christopher
tell me about a character
I watched parts here and there so I was rather vague on some details
That is like true love.
Hello! How are you? Have you seen any good movies recently?
yes, it was all so real
yes!  
The movie was good - above average for sure, but not astounding. Which is a fine thing, for a movie, yes?
Oh, my god. I love actors. were there any others?
Do you remember the train that plows through downtown LA?
20 min?
it was captured by secret government laboratory
I like them. What's this one about?
and she kidnapped it to save it's life and kept it in her bathtup
Hi
Only female super hero... so far. :)
ohh 
I haven't seen Maleficent.
It looks like Aurora told Stefan about Maleficent. 
I don't recognize it either. What position does he play in the movie?
Do you agree with the ratings of the movie?
It was really hard to see the puppy get killed, it evoked so many emotions of sadness and anger!
What did you think of the movie? What was wrong with it?
And yes, he does decide to go to college. The parts w/ the tutor are in pursuit of that - the family and Miss Sue all work together to help him catch up on the work he's missed, and move forward, too.
I also saw the movie as a kid.  I remember it being funny.
Downey JR, Chris Evans, Ruffalo, Hemsworth, Johnasson are amazing actors
I think the cast was top-notch. 
I watched parts here and there so I was rather vague on some details
Yeah me too, was great talking to you. Take care :)
rich reserves of humor
Yes, see you soon too.
He doesn't because he loves Mia so much he wants to make her proud
Hello! How are you? Have you seen any good movies recently?
who was mccorom again?
I watched it at least twice.. it was that good.  I love female superheros
Hello
They liked it?
when he brought the moon close to her 
Hello!
How did the avengers become divided?
I wish it is still perfect. I don't like the idea of movies surpassing a trilogy but that is just my opinion. But I always trust Pixar haha.
And the sequel as well
I have seen trailers and such, and a few bits here and there of Batman/Superman but can't make myself watch it.
I think you should. it's an enjoyable watch that makes you think. Bye!
You should try watching the 1975 film jaws!  It has a rating of 97% on Rotten Tomatoes.  
Oh right, because she has a fairy godmother. I love the multi-universe concept. Disney did that with Marvel. 
What kind of emotions?
Also, highly recognizable, that's a plothole in my opinion
*out
Any reviews?
bye :)
You don't think so?
It sounds like something I would watch. Than you for the recommendation!
Yes, the director of it was Morten Tyldum
Yeah it is a perfect animated featureb
That definitely makes it sound a little better. I heard there was some backlash about the racial parts of the movie. Do you think any part of the movie made you uncomfortable?
I agree, this is more of a historical film like the scenes where Britain declares war on Germany
yes , he is awesome in it!
Yes!  And, a well crafted one, at that.  It was produced by Universal.   It's obviously digitally animated.  More along the lines of Pixar movies.  And, the soundtrack is amazing.
I agree them great in the Avengers   movie. 
I love that movie, it helped me as a kid to take care of my toys, and I am being serious.
it is a humanoid amphibian
Hi, how are you?
and all the action was good
same enjoy ur day
Hello!
I assume that was named after Christopher morcom
Hello! 
lol i mean he was playing god so it had o be a lil dramtic
Thanks for telling me about it, sounds really interesting!
exactly
how descriptive
Frank* is gonna disappear again. Sorry for the typo, got excited!
I think they have a strong defense to beat the Chitauri invaders. 
did she release it back?
I love home alone when it came it, great movie!
Im suprised its so low
I didn't know that
 Pharrel wrote the main theme song and performs it: the lyrics are peppy and comical.  There are other contemporary and classical pieces that help weave the narrative together.
do you watch movies based on the cast or the rating?
Of course. 
and without a doubt she is a great actress
It's been awhile, but I've seen it too. It was really good!
Ooh, I loved seeing that part in the theater! As soon as the screen cut to black, you could hear everyone's frustration!
of coarse
Do you think the Genre should be Drama
amazing hoiw technogoly has advanced 
Marvel's The Avengers is a 2012 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt DisneyStudios Motion Pictures
yes , I did
yeah, you can't just copy/paste what would be the point?
I h aven't seen it, no
also, Steve carrell is the main character in the sequel, Evan almighty
I think my favorite bit was actually at the end, when you're not sure if Dom is in reality or not...when the scene cuts away from the top before you know if it stops spinning or not.
I think I will!
the movie just jumped forward passed that. Seb didn't have much growth either. He stayed a jazz snob
Yes, he's quite good.
In what sense? Where does it take place?
That is sad
At one point, Frank is arrested an taken to jail and there is a flash forward where it skips in time, but eventually Tom Hanks (Carl Hanratty, in the film) convinces the FBI to take Frank on to work with them.
I know:-), I'm so curious now! I will definitely check it out this weekend! 
Menzies tells the cryptographers to destroy their work so they can never tell anything about the machines
In what sense?
without the crypo anbalyssi would have been very hard during ww2
The plot seems pretty good to me so it is definitely   award worthy
Our Movie was titled SUPERHERO
it's a big "wrong place wrong time" kind of ending, which sucks because you really start to root for them. 
how would have you rated this movie?
Did you think that it was a sad part of the movie?
Well this film takes place back when prejudice is still very common, and the main character is best friends with a black woman and a gay man, so it really delves into that 
Wow, Maleficent tried to let Stefan live and Stefan just had forever rage for her.
Yea film critics are too stiff. You should watch this movie
So Aurora is supposed to be Sleeping Beauty!
What do you think about the defense of the team
Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling play the leads
hi
I️ meant 2003
The main character is an orphan who was found in a river.
I've heard of it. Whats it about?
Wait, so there is no prince charming?
Benedict Cumberbatch was a great actor in the lead role
Yes, I saw the movie with my children.
It made me want to go back to see her
it's a big "wrong place wrong time" kind of ending, which sucks because you really start to root for them. 
And the sequel as well
I'd give it a good strong nine. 
Hi there, this is like one of my favorite movies
Downey JR, Chris Evans, Ruffalo, Hemsworth, Johnasson are amazing actors
I think you are refering to Alfie Allen performance. That was not shi top notch
What is your initial opinion on the movie? Without going into depth? Do you like it or not?
During this time, Seb feels so out of sorts. the band he's in is finding success in pop music but because he's such a jazz pureist, he wants to quit
I agree.  I think I saw all of them, but I don't remember them that well.  I'm even thinking the last one wasn't the same characters, but I could be wrong. 
rich reserves of humor
I may try to see if my nieces  can come over and watch it too
they meet and fall in love in LA while pursing their dreams
Hahaha.
Well they meet for a second time at a party and Seb is in a 80's cover band. They have this chemistry that is ignored and they go on with their lives for a while
The actor was Robert Downey JR
Awesome! I'm going to have to check that out.
Or rather, does a movie need high-profile actors to be good?
Very clever woman. It def stood out from all the other American teen movies that were so popular around that time
Then they slowly start falling for each other over the course of a few dates
Well, I want to watch the movie now.
I was told that the Super/Batman movie was trash.
Yes, they used it to decrypt the messages the Nazis were sending
Well, that's the take away- being a super hero or a super villain is entirely your choice. Gru ends up being a super hero by vanquishing Vector (the up-and-coming villain).
Have you seen it?
This was one of lindsay lohan's bigger successes. it made her very well known. although i think it made amanda seyfried well known too. she was so pretty in this film. it made a fan out of me.
Jim Carrey things nothing goes right for him and complains to god. Morgan freeman plays god and lets him play god for a week
hey
What’s the story line?
Does he get to sing?
Yes, the main antagonist is the man who brought the creature to the lab, Richard Strickland. 
Do they make it in the end, both as a couple and in their respective careers?
Also very good
It's like Sleeping Beauty but not animated.
They weren't the best signers I've ever heard but it wasn't like Le Mes bad
yeah but still, Jim Carrey's having an accident and the whole love drama
I find it hard to believe rotten tomatos ratings also! it should be like at least a 8 or 9!
John Legend has a small role
So the figure became her best friend, huh?
So it ends a bit sadly then. But I guess that's how real life goes.
Or rather, does a movie need high-profile actors to be good?
It was Directed by: Jon Favreau
Wow I kinda figure that. 
Near the end, where she literally redirects the lighting to kill Ares. Yours? 
dram biopic movie
hi
Did you see The Shape of Water?
I never seen it before. Please tell me about the film
Not dislike, per se, but there were elements that were harder to watch. For example, the scene w/ the mother's racist friends was disturbing - not least b/c it was so realistic. And when Michael goes back to his childhood home and his time with the gang members there turns violent, it's stressful and sad to think it might derail Michael's future.
I think I saw that many many years ago.  How many Jaws movies did they make?
yea that was cool
Thanks for having the chat
Sorry. Didn't see the chat had started. 9 out 10.
The beginning of the story is great because it tells how Frank had a hard time financially and how he fell into conning as a way to get by
Oh, I love Steve Carroll!
More personal really. She lacked depth. She was just an actress who tried and failed many times then found success  
The ending is really good too
The story is pretty interesting too, has fantasy elements.
 I said that soon I will see the movie
I didn't want to end up like Sid. LOL.
It received numerous, positive reviews. I would recommend seeing it.  Kids will definitely like it.8
Do Emma and Ryan sing well in the movie?
Ah that sounds good...though I wouldn't mind seeing this plot with Catwoman in the lead
would agree and I like to warch Keira knightly too
I will admit she did a good job. She always seemed.... too small for the role. Maybe I'm just comparing it to the 70's TV show.
It was quite cute! Created by Illumination Entertainment in 2010, the main story follows an aging Supervillian named "Gru."  Gru has a posse of "minions" who do the heavy lifting for him.  
Hello!
I’ve heard of this movie but don’t remember seeing it
Marvel's The Avengers is a 2012 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt DisneyStudios Motion Pictures
It has a funny title. 
intersting topic cryopto for me too
Maleficent basically gets a bird to spy on Stefan like a stalker. It's quite funny.
Pretty good score
That's good
I like how the clean up crew comes in too....they are comical! lol
ohh sorry 
Oh!, I liked also the Mustang that starts the second scene
 user 2 left the chat now what do I do????
70 shows compared to shows now are very different
who in it?
It seems like they tackled the reality of the situation really well. It would make me uncomfortable to see the more racist elements, but that is a part of life. I hope the movie helps other people see the reasons to try and overcome issues. Do you have a favorite scene?
yeah so many nice cars, reminds me of fast and furious
Who is his favorite character  in the movie?
now I remember Jennifer Aniston was also in that movie
thanks! bye
That is crazy love. If you can't be in love with someone, then no one can?
Yeah, I really liked the ending, while it wasn't perfect, it was real
It is an original concept, for sure.  If you tend towards an appreciation for silly humor, the minions have  you covered. They often get themselves into very Rube-Goldberg-esque shennanigans.
Well it's a really good movie, what kind of genres are you interested in?
the cop knocked on the door after a scene and he opens the door and the cop is like "is everything ok" lol and he is like yeah. it was comical. 
What tunes are in the soundtrack that u mentioned.
Sebastian character is sort of annoying. I mean he's into jazz and is suppose to be this great musician , but is a compete snob about it.  Def not a likable character even towards the end really 
Who does he play?
same here.  Thank you also.  bye
the enigma machine is an important historical item 
I assume that was named after Christopher morcom
I mean not rated well
What do you think about the 4th  scene?
wow...that really sounds original. never seen anything like that
So the guy was going to do a experiment on the cre ature and the mute lady will stop him? Or that isn't true?
It's great. Care to hear about the ending?
Yes, that was instrumental to solving the mysteries of the enigma machine
It was like an existential crisis
It does: but, it's appropriate.  One of the central conflicts in the film revolves around Gru's perception of himself.  As the "super villian", he sees himself as a "despicable" person. However, during the course of the movie, you see that he actually has a very big heart
I like things I can share with my parents
It's got a few things going on - family (well-off folks adopt a poor teenager), sports (teen's a football star, how will he get into college?), and some social commentary about all of the above.
I want to remove his nose and stuck into Buster's poop.
Did not know cant copy
it's funny how the character was home schooled because her parents were zoologists working in africa. no wonder she had to be educated on the clicks in the beginning  of the movie. 
Thanks you too
interested how the homosexual part played a role
Yeah, and the the users gave is 8.4/10
Ahaha sorry the title was Iron Man.. my mistake ohh my
Cool! I have those so I will check that out.
I usually don't trust those scores so much. i tend to go with viewer ratings instead of critics ratings. people have better tastes than critics. 
ultinmalety tels the people to destroy the crypto graoph machine why?
I love Woody! He’s a really sassy cowboy! I loved the scene where Buzz found out there were other versions of him
Morgan is the man. 48% on rotten tomatoes but it’s much better than that
possible
There's some scenes with the use of guns.
due to technology
So do you think you will watch this movie
Menzies tells the cryptographers to destroy their work so they can never tell anything about the machines
like one where the girl, Mia hears the boy,  Sebastian playing the piano  in a bar but he brushes her off 
Yes, it was moving! I teared up, for sure.
I  have heard about it
oh right, she plays a good character  
What did you think of the film
his recalibration of machine after an epiohany
I can agree with that
good early storyline on how he got involved in crypto work '
that good
Mine as well. I think Gal Gadot did a good job portraying Wonder Woman.
Yes, it was the first time.  To gruesome for children to watch.  
I were going to ask what happens at the end but I will wait to see it
Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling play the leads
how about you?
yeah and critics have certain snob appeal. they tend to like movies that are artsy, although it's not all that entertaining. personally i prefer to be entertained. i mean i like some snobbish movies, but still
Can you tell me the name of any good movie you have seen recently?
I like action, comedy, horror type of movies
Yes
Well I'm glad it was as big as it was as the message it sent out to teenage girls hopefully got through to some because high school days are stressful enough to be worrying about why you are/aren't in a clique. It's good to be different!
Does he get to sing?
The guy has a suit, though. An iron suit
ah mean girls. such a funny movie. have you seen it? 
It's got really good scores on all the movie rating webpages
how come. thought tina fey's writing was fantastic in it. she did an amazing job adapting a self help book
 I need another account in mturk and they do not approve me: / I'm desperate
Doesn't look like it.
What do you think about the 3rd scene?
She is! 
Then they slowly start falling for each other over the course of a few dates
So, what'd you think of Steve Trevor? The love interest? 
Yeah, I'm pretty sure we're done.
Great! Have you ever seen the film, Catch Me If You Can? I'd like to talk about it with you if you'd like. 
Do you agree with the ratings of the movie?
I enjoy chatting with you. have a good day
Sounds like a good plan.  Make sure you have bananas- the minions like them.
Yeah, it has a bunch of great scenes where the two don't quite connect 
So it ends a bit sadly then. But I guess that's how real life goes.
Lol, hilarious, you kidding me? Of course! Arguably the best of all time!
 no doubt, the lazy part
Oh wow! That's a lot of great actors!
Do you like sci-fi movies in general?
She was great in her role as Joan Clarke
yes she did
so i guess Gru is despicable?
Thor's brother Loki from subjugating earth
 if we must always be attentive, a question how long this study lasts?
I enjoyed it, one of my favored comic book adaptations
One of the things I wasn't a fan of was the fact that  Mia  didn't really have any development. 
It;s not very often a movie gets a CinemaScore A and I'm glad it did as it sent out a very positive message
zootopia
Haha, no need in trying. I love Buzz because he was hilarious in the Tea party scene haha.
I think I may re-watch the movie sometime soon
John Legend has a small role
Was he the old guy that lived next door that they kids were all freaked out by?  
Yes, I agree!  Do you remember who Marley was? Played by Roberts Blossom?  I don't remember that character. 4
What about Emma's character, is she likable?
Yeah. gotta organize a movie night for it. popcorn, etc.
I see. i didn't realize it was 14 years ago. you're right. Man. now I feel old. i remember seeing this in the theaters. i guess you disagree that it's one of top 50 teen comedies, at least according to rotten  tomatoes
what was the Rotten Tomatoes score, then?
He's played by Quinton Aaron. I don't know the name - do you? Maybe I'd recognize his photo...
I always forget that Woody had a girlfriend BoPeep! I heard the 4th movie they’re making is about 
In what sense?
What do you think about the key scene?
how did you enjoy jim carrey movie bruce almighty
Of course
Do you think a good movie needs high-profile actors? 
I think its a great movie, what do you think of it? 
Hello! 
Ahh... yes
I might have to watch it to see what you mean. I think failing and trying again shows real depth.
Also just visually beautiful  
Slinky Dog was one my favorites too because when I was a kid I had a dachshund dog. :)
Well, it's a fantasy/Drama film. 
I love how it was set in WWI era   as well. 
That sounds funny, I like Morgan Freeman
What do you think about the key scene?
Yes, this was based on a true story, though there are certainly some artistic licenses throughout the film, but the nonetheless a good watch with great acting.
During this time, Seb feels so out of sorts. the band he's in is finding success in pop music but because he's such a jazz pureist, he wants to quit
Yes, they used it to decrypt the messages the Nazis were sending
Great thank you! Are you an animation fan?
BTW, I can't believe in was released 4 years ago
Yeah, I really liked the ending, while it wasn't perfect, it was real
How about you?
I liked Monsters ( the movie). in it the monsters are under the bed, but turn out to be friendly. Great movie to take the kids to. 
I think you are suppose to be asking questions
Any other questions about the movie?
The story line is about the life of Frank Abagnale (Leo DiCaprio) who is a con artist who conned millions of dollars by posing as a Pan American Airways pilot, a Georgia doctor, and a Louisiana parish prosecutor.
hey now
What did you think of Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman?
I don't agree with the fact that the document says the genre is "scientific". I think the movie's  more of a thriller.
Yeah it turns out being a homosexual played a big part in Turing's life
Yes, the director of it was Morten Tyldum
Any other questions about the movie?
  and history also captivated me
those ppl who felt like that move wasnt funny are the same ppl who thim amy is funny
also, Steve carrell is the main character in the sequel, Evan almighty
and the CinemaScore is an A
yes
I didn't know that
I wasn't sure about those two to start out with, they just didn't seem like they'd be good together  
Well, I guess that's a happy ending then!
What happens next?
Doug Jones is in it too, he does great creature work.
Yes - Sandra Bullock is the mother, and Tim McGraw is the father. I didn't know he acted, did you? 
 Can this study be repeated?
Yeah it kinda difficult to get someone into this film since everyone is. Whose your favorite character by the way?
Morgan is the man. 48% on rotten tomatoes but it’s much better than that
Angelina Jolie in Maleficent was amazing!
dreamy
I️ meant 2003
That is very good
I might have can you get indeep with your favorite seen of the movie.
Oh really, that is kind of weird. I would have thought it was more of a Fantasy.
Sally Hawkins was the main actress
I would too. Don’t blame him for worrying. 
yes,this rigth
Oh yes, Caimcross was a soviet spy
Yeah I agree especially about Rotten Tomatoes, I've really enjoyed movies before that if having read the reviews beforehand would have maybe put me off & resulted in me missing a good movie!
which scene do you remember and like the most?
Great. Well it is a biographical crime directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Christopher Walken, and Amy Adams (to name a few).
Oh yes, Caimcross was a soviet spy
yes,the Avengers teams are very good
I do, classic hollywood is a favorite
:)
I agree
I saw it a few years ago again.  Its a fun Christmas movie.  I remember Gus the polka band player was played by John Candy
It say that a custodian falls in love with an amphibian creature?!
not at first she didnt
Have you seen it?
How mdid you like british cryptography moives
Yes, I agree - it's good to show it, and good to make people uncomfortable, so they think about it and hopefully see what's wrong. I think my favorite scene is when Michael questions Leigh Anne (mother) about her motives for taking him in. It was an important conversation to have, and not an easy one, but ultimately Michael's okay w/ what she says - and it shows that he's finally feeling safe enough to have opinions about things.
What do you think about the 3rd scene?
He loves Buzz Lightyear.  
his recalibration of machine after an epiohany
Wow. That seems really moving honestly.
 if it's a pretty interesting movie to hang out
Don Rickles is the voice of Mr. Potato Head.  
I'm not sure Cat Woman would fit well, in this case.  Really, It pokes fun at the concept of super villains and the  stereotypical "crimes" they often pursue.   Gru, in this movie, wants to steal the moon...but is foiled by another up-and-coming super villain.  In the end, he ends up giving the moon to his girls...which is  a cute stereotype of a good father.
Still for it's limits, it is improbably fun to watch, due to it's characters.
Indeed.
Movie name
jim carrey was the right choice with that movie
What do you think about the second scene?
What do you think about this wonderful movie?
the ending is really good to when he gets another dog!
yes,the Avengers teams are very good
This is my 1st time! Urs too?
I was never into comics but watching these movies makes me more of a fan.
Where did Thor take the Tesseract to?
movie was cvool ioverall.
finest expression
did u see it with kids, btw?
I don't think mine did yet.
I liked it a lot
thank you good chat to you
It has good reviews from everyone
What do you think about the second scene?
I'm really interested to find out the where exactly this film came within the top 50 result of teen comedies
Ok. Thank you. Bye!
you're not supposed to do that, dude.
Did the story just change on the side
I mean I also loved Woody, he is always there for you, I just wanted Buzz because he was hilarious haha.
yes,this rigth
So do you think you will watch this movie
That is so true!
Hello. How are you? I am not entirely sure about what question to ask, so I'll just ask: do you think the critics were fair in their critique of the movie?
No, I had forgotten about that part entirely.
I agree, that's why I had to rated it an 8. 
It's sad that Stefan drugs her and cuts her wings with Iron.
How mdid you like british cryptography moives
I have yet to see any of the superman movies to be honest.
enjoy watching
It shows people dying on screen too.
Does he decide to go to college?
Me too
names his machine christopher
Well, I don't know how you feel about romantic comedies 
now computers here but before nothiog could compare top it except the huim,an brain
Do you think a good movie needs high-profile actors? 
One of his best movies is Bruce almighty, have you heard of him
It must be really cool to see a movie where the toys that you grew up with are sentient and fun characters
Nooo! I had him as toy so he’ll always be in my heart 
I remember jumping in my seat because it was so startling.
yes
What is your initial opinion on the movie? Without going into depth? Do you like it or not?
That's true. Maybe some people didn't like that it was a white family helping a black boy? I'm not sure. I did like when they got Michael a tutor - she was outspoken and nice, so her personality added some fun to the goings-on. And seeing him become happier and feel loved while doing better at football was great...inspiring, hopeful, that sort of thing. 
i think he told her tho i cant remember
 but you did not do it, then because you choose it if you did not see it
In what sense? Where does it take place?
hello you there? 
 You have not really seen the movie ...
Im suprised its so low
alright. Sounds good.
Yes, a mysterious creature shows up one day and she is intrigued and decides to visit him and they form a close bond.
it
What is the title of the movie?
It can be, but not always. I'm personally not that interested in Sports. How heavily does that impact my ability to watch it?
not familiar with him but a good movie
And they are usually pretty good about putting funny stuff for adults in them as well. 
By reading the last seen Marley is the old neighbor guy.  Everyone thought he was scary but Kevin helped him reunited with his son and granddaghter
Ok good bye.
What kind of emotions?
Hope you enjoyed the movie, from what you said I don't know to much about it, I'll have to check it out sometime soon .
When you watched the movie what did you think about Caimcross
Yeah, it's interesting when stars in other areas cross over to new ones, right?
How did the avengers become divided?
Well they meet for a second time at a party and Seb is in a 80's cover band. They have this chemistry that is ignored and they go on with their lives for a while
I'm not surprised,. Did Shapes of water won a Oscar?
the fight of the amazons when men arrive on their island
I remember jumping quite a bit during Inception!
I suppose it's just all about personal preference, my favourite American comedy films include anything with Will Ferrol & Seth Rogan so more slapstick films. I'm sure this was the movie that made Lindsay Lohan huge even though she had starred in m ovies from her early years
Benedict Cumberbatch was a great actor in the lead role
yeah can't recall any of his other movies. amanda seyfried did pretty well after the mean girls though 
But Maleficent awakens Sleeping Beauty?
Hello there.
I love that part too..
oops.
How do they fall in love then?
I like the way he was responding the prayers by email :)
And Woody said Bo peep, that was heartbreaking.
oh man. that sounds great. who else was in it?
I don't think it was anything wrong with the movie. The action was awesome but I prefer other types of movies. 
yeah it would be nice if they came out with a pre sequel, is that a prelude? like showing him in his past days and his wife
She is. I enjoy this section where she attempts to do a women show and I was caught up in the emotions during this scene. She's such a great actress that the execution  is so believable it sounds like a story of a friend of a friend 
yeah. more often than not, teen comedies tend to be slap stick type. this was a lot more cerebral. i wonder if the actress who played regina did any more movies. she was fantastic in the movie 
He almost killed Woody! >:(
Some emotions
I can agree with that
Also, I forgot to say - the story's also based on his real family, the Tuohys.
Steve Carrel does some amazing voice work, as the main character.
Hello, have you seen the movie Despicable Me?
She was amazing.
Yes, he's quite good.
*out
Do you like old movies
Hey there, how are you?
I liked that , by the way of the Mustang stealing, it gets establshed the previous story of Jhon Wick as a top assassin.
y
Yes, she did. She did very well. The movie, and the star, surprised me with how good they were. Especailly after the mess of the Superman/Batman movie.
It's still not finished .
Got it! Are there any star actor/actresses in it?
Is it suitable  movie for children?
interested how the homosexual part played a role
Lol! Now which one wade Buster? Was he the pig?
amazing hoiw technogoly has advanced 
haha, yes, there were so many action scenes for they to clean after
what do you think the critic means by saying "sadistic festival of adult bashing"?   It would be a different perspective, but I still think it would be funny, dont you?
I forgot about that scene. Now that you think about it.... naw I still like the guy
Do they make it in the end, both as a couple and in their respective careers?
I.T is a Science fiction comedy hybrid
doesnt like a cop how up too thats a friend? 
They must be good then!
Oh.. that's sound very interesting. Do they have to face any enemies in the film?
Yeah it won a lot of them. 
yes
Hmmm, sounds a lot like those story about Mermaid-like creatures that our government is supposedly trying to hide!:-)
I agree
the movie
or never mind i forgot his friend chris'
I mean, the movie is still fresh and with so much style for a crafty revenge thriller
Did you think that it was a sad part of the movie?
i agree, i thought the movie was funny
I think you are right that there are 3.  I never saw the other 2.  Usually remakes are not that good.
I hear you - I'm not super-into Sports, either. There's a lot more going on that makes it a good watch: Michael runs away from foster care + football offers a way for him to feel better about himself and life; Leigh Anne's friends question the safety of adopting him via thinly veiled racism and classism; there's a bit about him becoming comfortable with his talents. Sound any better? :)
He made millions calling out money forgers and also made millions creating unforgeable checks
I am a fan of comic books. At various times I've read both marvel and DC. Although, MArvel does seem to make better movies.
Something you don't get with movies most of the time
What do you think is the best part of the scene?
Hi! Just reading about "The Blind Side" movie - have you seen it?
Yeah it turns out being a homosexual played a big part in Turing's life
 Where are you from?
I can't either.  She probably felt horrible.  Funny how she fought to get a flight home and didn't want to wait but her family made it back the same exact time.
So, I should see Bruce Almighty first?
Awesome cast!
How do they fall in love then?
I really liked when everyone woke up on the plane. You get so invested in the dream layers, that you forget where it all started.
He's an offensive lineman - a big, athletic guy.
Cool. Think this was based on a true story
I hated Mr. Potato head!
Do you know about how long the movie is?
did you see it?
Do you think the Genre should be Drama
I did not like the end of the movie though
Sadly no. they drift away as their careers go in different directions. He misses an important play and she moves back home
I think they meant to say "Science Fiction"
Ah I see. Who is the story based on?
I have seen the movie so much, I practically have it memorized
Yes
It would make more sense! It is from Disney!
California I'm always here watching movies
Hello!
I agree. So many of the kids movies are so great nowadays that I enjoy watching them too!
Overall, I like the movie.  It has some high-profile actors.  What about you?
got good reviews as I see from rotten tomatoes and others
Some emotions
:) yes doing that thing without thinking any consequences
Yes, he got involved with Christopher Morcom who sparked his interest in crypto
 and what is your favorite part
I can still remember the pressure of that stage in life and it was a long time ago although my daughter is nearly 13 so I;m trying to make sure she has the self confidence to not feel the need to follow the in crowd as the damage it can do to teenage girls can be very serious
I only seen a few parts of it, but I was interested to finishes it .
The RottenTomatoes score is 92%.
Chris Pine is a good actor and his handsome looks make it better.
There's also some nudity.
2005
now computers here but before nothiog could compare top it except the huim,an brain
I don't see it as adult bashing.  Maybe I forgot some parts.  But I could see it happening. accidents do happen.  
I think the cast was top-notch. 
She did seem small for the role but she knocked it out the park.
I would agree. historically good too
It definitely is.  My son is 3 years old and he has loved this movie for almost a year.
0-100, I'd give it a 97 or so.
An NFL player named Michael Oher. He played for Baltimore.
I had partly forgotten about the love story aspect of the film.  You?
Is there anything that you didn't like about the movie?
It's about a actress and a musician.
i you want. no pressure
Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man, an industrialist, genius inventor, and consummate playboy, he is CEO of Stark Industries and a chief weapons manufacturer for the U.S. military. ● Terrence Howard as James "Rhodey" Rhodes, a friend of Stark's, and the liaison between Stark Industries and the United States Air Force in the department of acquisitions, specifically weapons development. ● Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane, Stark's business second-in-command, mentor and friend who turns on him to overtake the company, eventually building a giant exosuit to fight Stark. ● Shaun Toub as Yinsen, Stark's fellow captive, who grafts an electromagnet to Stark's chest "to keep the shrapnel shell shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him", and who helps Stark build the first Iron Man suit. ● Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, Stark's personal assistant and budding love interest.
Also ok
I would agree. historically good too
Career wise or personal like?
no problem
Hi there
I think we're on the last page of the document
Just that some people found it offensive. Then again, who doesn't find things offensive? What else did you enjoy about the film?
y
how do we submit the task?
I can take or leave Jen Aniston
Interesting. is it kid friendly?
Yes.. Rotten Tomatoes: 94% and average: 7.7/10 Metacritic Score: 79/100   CinemaScore: A
That would be nice! There is nothing better than movie night!
She is. I enjoy this section where she attempts to do a women show and I was caught up in the emotions during this scene. She's such a great actress that the execution  is so believable it sounds like a story of a friend of a friend 
I read that also and don't really get it either.  I still find it funny and don't see it as adult bashing.  What are your thoughts?
He was so panicky hahaha.
All good!
cool story factor about him tryingto be fired
would agree and I like to warch Keira knightly too
What about Emma's character, is she likable?
Somewhat. I haven't seen it in a few years.
I think all 3 were fair!
Yes. He's a clever boy. I wouldn't have been able to think of half the tricks
I like how every dream seems like it starts in the middle of the action, just like real dreams
Wait I.T was actually 2005! I’m sorry
Very much so!
american pie is the classic slap stick teen comedy. and it was good. anyway. that's all for me 
That's true.
I agree, this is more of a historical film like the scenes where Britain declares war on Germany
Hi, how are you?
Funny.  Good message of how looks can be deceiving.    And I don't know.  Do we hit the finish conversation button at the bottom?  Or will be direct us when finished?
it is a 2017 fantasy Drama movie
I was trying to just give some information
no
No, I haven't. Is it any good?
Bet he was a good worker for the fbi. Knowing all the little tricks criminals use
Do you know when it came ou?
I think you should. it's an enjoyable watch that makes you think. Bye!
without the crypo anbalyssi would have been very hard during ww2
wow that sounds intriguing! 
letting everyone win the lottery
Oh, it's a good one,my kids love that movie
Well, it's a very good way to distract the mind
I like them a lot, The Imitation Game was a good example of this
I believe he plays the captured humanoid amphibian creature
It's definitely  added to my list of ones to see!
There is certainly a thriller aspect to it, but it's solidly sci-fi
Maybe, I don't really remember that part. 
I didn't either! That's wild. Did you enjoy the movie?
dramatic
Honestly, I like movies about that length too even though I'm an adult because if they're not really good, then I can get distracted and it's hard for me to sit still too long
huh. that's a good question. i don't know that either. i'd say pretty high probably in the top 10. 
not so sure
they meet and fall in love in LA while pursing their dreams
good early storyline on how he got involved in crypto work '
She eventually keeps the creature in a bathtub.
Oh I had one too! He was a really cute yet reliable character with his slinky ways. Mr potato head is delightful as well
Sebastian character is sort of annoying. I mean he's into jazz and is suppose to be this great musician , but is a compete snob about it.  Def not a likable character even towards the end really 
or never mind i forgot his friend chris'
Yes it added a second key scene.  The one where Kate realizes he is missing and tries to get a flight home
Toy story is a computer animated movie featuring the voices of of great names!  It all centers around a young boy Andy and his toys.  The toys pretend to be lifeless when people are around but when they are alone the fun beings!
got good reviews as I see from rotten tomatoes and others
so  good 
That's ok
She was great in her role as Joan Clarke
Yeah he wants to kill the creature to study it and she hatches a plan with her friends to help save him
I do, classic hollywood is a favorite
I haven't seen much Marvel. I think that Aurora is going to betray Maleficent. 
Absolutely!  It's less than an hour an a half.  Perfect to keep the interest of the little ones
Them finding her 
Despite her dislike, She cares for Aurora and watches over her. 
yes
Oh I haven't seen Frozen. Maleficent is considered a Superhero Genre
I’m all about spoilers lol
it was nice to talk
Hello!
Was it well regarded by critics
When you watched the movie what did you think about Caimcross
The movie is a bit violent though, as long as you don't mind that.
it depends
Wonder woman was awesome, and was a hast introduction to the character. Well it was her first full length movie. 
I mean not rated well
n wen he made her boobs big with her knowing
well, the critics do not say the same thing
Do Emma and Ryan sing well in the movie?
Thanks for the info and I hope you have a great day!
Who does Don Rickles play?
I also like the bellman at the hotel.  played by Lance Reddick
Yes, each dream layer was a world in itself!
Are there any other famous actors beside Emma and Ryan?
A bit. He has a duet with Emma. He also sings a song or two by himself 
You may recognize some of the voices in the movie.  Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, and Jim Varney
He ends up adopting three girls and learns to parent creatively and ends up choosing "his girls" over the chance to be the bigger villain on earth.
Oh, and it's based on a true story.
I am doing great, thanks for asking.
"Maleficent" gets rid of stereotypes found in Frozen.
Where did Thor take the Tesseract to?
She eventually learns to communicate with a creature she finds at her work.
I agree
I haven't seen it since it came out, I don't think.  I just remember loving the dream aspect of the film.  Reading the introduction makes me want to watch it again too!
Thor's brother Loki from subjugating earth
You really felt that she embraced that role.
Have you watched this movie before?
I'm the same way.  It's also great because there are not any "slow" parts so it peaks your interest the whole time
And they grow apart. She is the protector of the Moors forest.
And yeah, Bo peep. I was heartbroken when Woody was counting their lost family members since Andy was growing old.
When you have that big of a family it definitely could happen.  I do agree with the first critic saying the first half is flat.  I remember it taking a bit to become funny.  All the funny parts are the pranks he plays on the robbers
Oh yes. I enjoyed watching it with my family growing up.
I think that I might watch it, but it's not at the top of my list.
No, I haven't. Is it any good?
I just remembered they called him Old Man Marley and thought he killed someone and buried him.  He was always outside shoveling and had a garbage can with him. 
That is true.  I just saw at the top of my document it says this is the end of the document and now the finish conversation button can be clicked.  I looked back at the instructions too and saw that.  I think we are good and can click finish.  Thank you
She gets payback. I like that!!
Sally Hawkins is mute in it, which is impressive as an actor.
are you a marvel fan?
The shape of water is a great movie
I have not heard about this movie before
It's about a actress and a musician.
On the m turk it says will take about twenty minutes.  It is going on 30.  It says you have to talk 12 times, which I am sure we did
Good. Have you heard of actor jim carrey
the movie is still great though for my taste
you should watch it yourself
It felt genuine at the time or maybe the movies execution for the scenes were just so perfectly done.
Jim Carrey things nothing goes right for him and complains to god. Morgan freeman plays god and lets him play god for a week
Something you don't get with movies most of the time
good chat!
intersting topic cryopto for me too
One of his best movies is Bruce almighty, have you heard of him
ohh yes yes.. 
Any superheros?
Very much but it's ok to watch because kid's like asking questions during movie's
Yeah, the reviews were pretty much unanimously positive.
The billionare who's in the fire arm business
Hi good day
Hello. I’m great thanks 
Yea, I think Maleficent cheated on him or something. 
I prefer sci fy but got this vid instead\\
finest expression
So, I should see Bruce Almighty first?
intriguode with caimcross next
Do you know if they've made more than one of these movies? It sounds like they would be popular. 
It was filmed 2008
ultinmalety tels the people to destroy the crypto graoph machine why?
More personal really. She lacked depth. She was just an actress who tried and failed many times then found success  
I am not sure about that part either, I think he did not tell her
Have you seen Inception before?
I agree with them that Ruffalo was great in the movie. 
I would of gave it a 8 out of 10
from a scale from 0-100
There's about 5 questions then it should wrap up.
hi there
yeah, that's the part of genius writing on tina fey's part. she's really one of the most talented comedians of our time, in my opinion
Yes it did
Oh, that is funny. I think there is a link to Cinderella!
Hi there!
In some ways. She feels like they understand each other because she's mute and he doesn't judge her just like she doesn't judge him for being a strange fish creature.  
on her favorite times
I love fantasy
Yes, you can find it through your service provider or through a streaming service such as Netflix or Hulu.  
Yes I thought hte atmosphere and such was amazing, I would have loved to live there and learned how to fight like that.
Good clean fun for the entire family
who is the main character?
I can agree
That sounds interesting. Have you seen the movie before?
What do you think it's a good part in the middle of the movie
What do you think is the best part of the scene?
intriguode with caimcross next
As one critic responded "this is not a major Spielberg film, although it is an effortlessly watchable one"
 If I love her too, it really entertains me a lot, although it is still for children
It's not a bad thing.  Have you ever listened to kids try to speak pig latni?
yes
Ohh yeah.
Yes, the movie received a 96% on rotten tomatoes, but got a 76/100 on Metacritic.
